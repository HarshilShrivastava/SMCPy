SMCPy - **S**equential **M**onte **C**arlo **S**ampling with **Py**thon 
==========================================================================
Python module for uncertainty quantification using a parallel sequential Monte
Carlo sampler.

To operate the code, the user supplies a computational model built in Python
2.7, defines prior distributions for each of the model parameters to be
estimated, and provides data to be used for calibration. SMC sampling can then
be conducted with ease through instantiation of the SMC class and a call to the
sample() method. The output of this process is an approximation of the parameter
posterior probability distribution conditional on the data provided.

This software was funded by and developed under the High Performance Computing 
Incubator (HPCI) at NASA Langley Research Center.

## Example Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from smcpy.examples.spring_mass.spring_mass_models import SpringMassModel
from smcpy.smc.smc_sampler import SMCSampler

# Initialize model
state0 = [0., 0.]                        #initial conditions
measure_t_grid = np.arange(0., 5., 0.2)  #time 
model = SpringMassModel(state0, measure_t_grid)

# Load data
noise_stddev = 0.94
displacement_data = np.genfromtxt('noisy_data.txt')

# Define prior distributions
param_priors = {'K': ['Uniform', 0.0, 10.0],
                'g': ['Uniform', 0.0, 10.0]}

# SMC sampling
num_particles = 5000
num_time_steps = 20
num_mcmc_steps = 1
smc = SMCSampler(displacement_data, model, param_priors)
pchain = smc.sample(num_particles, num_time_steps, num_mcmc_steps, noise_stddev,
                    ess_threshold=num_particles*0.5)
if smc._rank == 0:
    pchain.plot_pairwise_weights(save=True)
```

The above code produces probabilistic estimates of K, the spring stiffness divided by mass, and g, the gravitational constant on an unknown planet. These estimates are in the form of weighted particles and can be visualized by plotting the pairwise weights as shown below. The mean of each parameter is marked by the dashed red line. The true values for this example were K = 1.67 and g = 4.62. More details can be found in the spring mass example (smcpy/examples/spring_mass/).
